## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `Dataset-group8.csv`. It contains information about houses, including features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, etc. The dataset is preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns (`id`, `Date`), and the remaining columns are used as input features (`X`) for training the model.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- `Dataset-group8.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of the house price prediction model using various metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the model.

The notebook also includes visualizations, such as scatter plots or line plots, to illustrate the predicted house prices compared to the actual prices.
